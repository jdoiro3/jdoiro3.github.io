Welcome to my blog! I'm glad you're here and hope you enjoy my thoughts. I'm currently a Software Engineer in Chattanooga, TN but born and raised in good ole south Louisiana. My wife, three cats and I moved here after graduating from LSU ([Geaux Tigers](https://www.tiktok.com/@theredshirts/video/7150382729396243754)). I enjoy drinking beer, traveling, playing my trumpet, running trails around Chattanooga, soccer with friends and supporting Tottenham Hotspur ([I like sports and I don't care who knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEVdca9U9LM)), going to the symphony and now blogging! They're so many things I want to do and look forward to having a place to share it with you all. I started this blog to improve my writing, share my thoughts on all sorts of topics and have a public journal. Hopefully, I can keep this up and may get my wife to write a few posts (she's a really good writer and sooo funny and the world needs to know).
