This past weekend we lost power for over 48 hours. An ordeal that started Saturday afternoon. Earlier that day I went on a 6 mile run with a buddy I met through my wife's work and his friend. It was a lot of fun; though, it was abnormally humid, a sign of the storm to come. When the storm did finally hit us it was extreme. This time, the extreme weather alert you get on your phone was not an exaggeration. We got 80+ mile per hour winds and it blew all the stuff on our porch everywhere. It felt like a tropical storm passed through but only lasted around 10 mins. We ended up losing power and when my wife got home from work, she told me how there were a lot of trees that fell. We decided to go on a walk to assess the extent of the damage in our neighborhood, something we always enjoy doing after a storm. On our walk, we realized the extent of the damage was worse than we thought. We saw quite a few downed trees. Some of them were very large. Luckily, we didn't see any that fell on a house but quite a few fell on power lines. That's when we realized we might be out of power for a while.

Realizing we probably weren't cooking tonight, unless we wanted to cook with our camping stove, we decided to see if our neighborhood pub, Tremont Tavern, still had power. It was a treacherous journey where we encountered another downed tree in the road but we eventually made it to Tremont and, to our amazement, they had power. Our refuge from the storm where we met another couple, on a date night, who were also from Louisiana, moving to Chattanooga a year ago. It's always nice meeting fellow Louisianians in Chattanooga.

After our dinner, we went back home. It was dark by then and the night sky was really beautiful with no light pollution. The storm also cooled the air some. It was a pleasant walk back to the house. Once we got back, we decided we didn't want to sleep with no A/C, so we called up our friends who had power, packed a few things and evacuated to their house. We thought for sure we'd have power back by Sunday, since there were plenty of linemen already working. We were wrong. After it was all said and down we didn't get our power back till Monday morning. We put some of our food in an ice chest to save it but we still lost some food that I'm still grieving (I'm so sorry I didn't save you chicken thighs). I want to thank all the emergency workers that responded after the storm and hard working linemen who got our power back on. It was a unique weekend we'll never forget.
